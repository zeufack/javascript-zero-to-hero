let and const are introduice in ES6 or emascript 2015, var is use since javascript was create

-> `const` is a signal that the identifier won't be reassignate.

-> `let` is a signal that the indentifier can be reassignate, sush as a cunter in a loop, or a value  swap 
in an algorithm. it also signal that the variable wil only be use in the block it defined in, witch is not always the
